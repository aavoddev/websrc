About this site
===============

This site was generated by a program of my own creation that goes by the name `wwc`. Both [wwc](http://github.com/aavoddev/wwc) and [this site](http://github.com/aavoddev/aavoddev.github.io) can be found on my github. `wwc` is meant to produce static sites that resemble sites built using the [werc](http://werc.cat-v.org) anit-framework, however, `wwc` doesn't allow for the same extensibility that `werc` does.
