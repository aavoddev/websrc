This is my personal site.

A lot of pages may be more hand-hold-y than is necessary, but they serve to document my process for problem solving that perhaps someone less experienced could benefit from; they're formatted in a way that I believe would have helped my past self. Anyone more experienced will probably find them to be boring at best, so be warned. Their usefulness is yet to be determined.
